# Structured Query Language (SQL)

## Simple Queries
```sql
-- Get some data, from one or more tables, and filter on the following filters
-- filters are predicates that define the scope of data and or the behavior
-- of how data is returned

-- A query to return all data (no rules);
select artist_id, name from artist;

-- A query to return an artist by a specfic name:
select artist_id, name from artist where name = 'Aerosmith';

-- A query to return all artists who's name starts with the letter 'A'
select artist_id, name from artist where name like 'A%';

-- A query to return all artists who's name starts with 'A' or 'a'
select artist_id, name from artist where LOWER(name) like 'a%';
```

## Joining Data

```sql
--- Find all of the albums an artist has created

--- An inner join  (only where values match)
select a.name, b.title from artist a inner join album b on a.artist_id = b.artist_id;

--- An left outer join (includes null matching)
select a.name, b.title from artist a left join album b on a.artist_id = b.artist_id;
```

## Aggregating queries

Sometimes you want to run computations on your data and have the server
do the work. Afterall, that's what it's built to do.

```sql
--- Get the total number of albums an artist has created
select a.name, count(b.artist_id) from artist a 
	join album b on a.artist_id = b.artist_id 
	group by (a.name, b.artist_id);
```

## Aggregation and Filters

```sql
--- Get the total number of albums by artist and list from most to least
select a.name, count(b.artist_id) as album_count from artist a 
	join album b on a.artist_id = b.artist_id 
	group by (a.name, b.artist_id) order by album_count desc;
